this keymap aims to minimize time-dependent behavior while making every key immediately accessible. it achieves this by using combos. 
the following characters and functions are accessed exclusively through combos:

alt
ctrl
gamelayer
mouselayer
tab
shift
capslock
defaultlayer
[ {
] }
esc
enter
osgui
- _
= +
' "
; :
` ~
printscreen

using combos to this extent removes the need for one-shot mods, one-shot layers, and hold-tap functions.   
see source code for more information.
