this keymap aims to minimize time-dependent behavior while making every key immediately accessible. it achieves this by using combos. the following characters and functions are accessed exclusively through combos:

alt ctrl gamelayer mouselayer tab shift momentary_mouselayer defaultlayer / ? \ | esc enter osgui [ { ] } = + ' " ; : ` ~ printscreen

using combos to this extent removes the need for one-shot mods, one-shot layers, and hold-tap functions.
see source code for more information.
